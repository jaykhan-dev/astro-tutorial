# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-08-03

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning astro! Here I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Learnt JavaScript**: When I came back from Montreal, I intended to learn how to build apps, but decided it wasn't really what I wanted to do.
2. **Learnt Copywritign**: Better to enhance the skills I already have.
3. **Find Clients**: For email and landing pages

## What's Next

I will make lots of money, pay off debt, and be free to go where I want. Help others.
